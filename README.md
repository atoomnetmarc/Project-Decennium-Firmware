This is the firmware for this PCB: https://github.com/atoomnetmarc/Project-Decennium

# Wi-Fi configuration

When no Wi-Fi configuration is known then the firmware will start an access point on SSID `decennium-`-something. Connect to it, then open http://192.168.4.1

When configured, pressing reset twice will also start the access point.
